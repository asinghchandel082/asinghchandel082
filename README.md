<h2 align="center">Hi, This is Ajay Singh Chandel ðŸ‘‹</h2>

Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst** with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights and optimizing business processes. My journey into data analytics is shaped by curiosity, continuous learning, and a dedication to growth. After completing my **Master's in Computer Applications (MCA)** in 2024 from **Kalinga Institute Of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar (KIIT University)**, I became deeply interested in **data analytics**. During my studies, I honed my skills in **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python**, which laid the foundation for my career. In **2023**, I discovered the world of **Data Analytics**, where I found the power of data to drive informed decision-making and strategic improvements. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects to further develop my analytical skills and contribute to impactful data-driven solutions.

## ðŸ›  Technical Skills

I have developed a strong technical foundation with expertise in **Programming Languages** such as **Python**, utilizing libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data manipulation and visualization. In **Database Management**, I am proficient in **SQL** and **MongoDB**, and I use **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI** as my primary tools for data analysis and reporting. My **core competencies** include **Data Analytics**, **Data Visualization**, **Data Reporting**, **Research and Analysis**, and **Problem Solving**, which I apply to extract valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I am familiar with the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, **ETL Processes**, and **Dashboard Design**, which further enhances my ability to work on diverse data projects.

## ðŸ’¼ Experience

In my role as a **Data Analyst Intern** at **KultureHire** from **November 2024 to April 2025**, I gained hands-on experience working with large datasets. I collected, cleaned, and standardized raw survey data related to **Gen Zâ€™s career aspirations**, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. I built interactive **Excel dashboards** using pivot tables to showcase trends in career choices, salary expectations, and job preferences, making complex data easily understandable for stakeholders. I also designed dynamic, stakeholder-oriented dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize workforce insights and support decision-making processes. During this internship, I wrote **SQL queries** to extract, join, and filter data for deeper analysis and validation. Furthermore, I contributed to a **Gartner report** by creating **5W1H documentation** (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How), which provided structured and actionable insights to business leaders. I worked closely with key stakeholders to tailor reporting solutions to meet their business intelligence goals.

**Tools Used:** Excel, SQL, Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service
